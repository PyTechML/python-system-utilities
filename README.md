# Python System Utilities

This repository contains a collection of small, focused Python utilities built
to solve real system-level problems.

The code here is not written to demonstrate language features or explain
concepts. Each script exists for a specific reason, performs a single task,
and reports its behavior clearly.

There are no tutorials in this repository.
Only tools.

## What this repository is

- A set of practical utilities for everyday system work
- Code written with predictable behavior and explicit output
- Scripts designed to be executed, not studied
- Internal-tool style implementations

## What this repository is not

- Not a beginner playground
- Not a collection of coding exercises
- Not optimized for cleverness or shortcuts
- Not built around frameworks or abstractions

## Included toolsets

- File organization and inspection
- Disk usage and size analysis
- Duplicate file detection
- Directory structure visualization
- Log inspection and summarization
- Environment configuration validation
- Network port inspection
- Time tracking utilities
- Password auditing and validation

Each folder is self-contained and can be used independently.

## Design philosophy

- Explicit input
- Minimal output
- Quiet failure where expected
- No hidden behavior
- No unnecessary comments

If the intent of a script is not clear by reading it,
the script does not belong here.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run individual scripts directly.
Each utility reports what it does and when it completes.

No setup. No dependencies. No surprises.
