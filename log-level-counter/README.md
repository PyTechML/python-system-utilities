# Log Level Counter Utilities

This folder contains utilities for inspecting log files and extracting
high-level signal from them.

The tools focus on counting and summarizing log entries by severity or pattern.
They are intended for quick audits, debugging sessions, or sanity checks during
incident analysis.
